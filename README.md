## Project Overview
This Natural Language Processing (NLP) project classifies restaurant reviews as positive or negative based on the review text.  
The goal is to perform sentiment analysis and build a robust text classification model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning (removing special characters, lowercasing, stemming, stopword removal)
2. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer
3. Model Building using Logistic Regression
4. Model Evaluation (confusion matrix, accuracy score)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
- Restaurant review dataset (CSV file of reviews and sentiment labels)

## Results
- Built an efficient sentiment analysis model.
- Achieved good accuracy on review classification.
